# AWS Static Stack GitHub Action

TODO: optionally copy html files to extensionless

A GitHub Action to deploy your static website to the AWS Edge ðŸ”¥.

_CURRENTLY IN ALPHA - NOT FIT FOR PUBLIC USE_

Includes:

- S3 for hosting files
- Cloudfront for Edge caching
- Caching headers configured correctly
- AWS Stack create/update (via CloudFormation)
- Preview websites (eg `branchname.preview.example.com`)
- File sync and invalidation by contents hash

## Getting Started

Before beginning you should understand the following:

- Various AWS resources will be created which which incur costs on your AWS account
- All AWS resources are created in the `us-east-1` region, as this is where the CloudFront control pane sits and requires resources (eg certificates & buckets) to be created in the same region. Also, there would be additional S3 data transfer charges if the Lambda@Edge executions are happening in a different AWS Region from where your source S3 bucket is located.

## Usage

First you need to create a certificate for your root and preview hosts, in the `us-east-1` region.

Open the [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1) and Request a new public certificate for the following domains:

- `example.com`
- `*.example`
- `*.preview.example.com`

Once the certificate is created & verified, copy the Certificate ARN and use it to configure the action:

```yaml
name: 'build-deploy'

concurrency:
  group: prod_deploy
  cancel-in-progress: false

on:
  repository_dispatch:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set Node.js 16.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.4.1
        with:
          node-version: 16.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Test
        run: npm test

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Deploy
        uses: badsyntax/github-action-aws-static-stack@v0.0.1
        with:
          outDir: './out'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          lambdaVersion: '1.0.0'
          cfStackName: 'static-example-cloudformation-stack'
          s3BucketName: 'static-example-info-us-east-1'
          s3AllowedOrigins: 'https://example.com, https://*.preview.example.com'
          rootCloudFrontHosts: 'example.com'
          previewCloudFrontHosts: '*.preview.example.com'
          previewUrlHost: 'preview.example.com'
          cacheCorsPathPattern: '/_next/*'
          certificateARN: 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:1234567:certificate/123abc-123abc-1234-5678-abcdef'
          removeExtensionFromHtmlFiles: true
```

Next, send a Pull Request to trigger the action.

- The Stack will be created/updated, and a new preview site deployed, for every Pull Request
- The Stack will be created/updated, and the root site deployed, for every push event to master/main/release branch

It will take 10-15mins for the initial stack to be created.

Once the stack has been initially created, you need to adjust your domain records to point to the relevant CloudFront distribution.

## Caching Strategy

- Immutable static files (eg images, JavaScript, CSS etc) are cached by both the browser and the Edge for 1 year. (Files can only be immutable if they do not change and typically use hashed filenames.)
- Mutable HTML files are cached by the Edge for 1 year, but never cached in the browser.
- Edge cache is invalidated on new deployments for changed HTML files.

## AWS Stack Overview

### S3

A single S3 bucket is used to host both the root and preview websites with the following directory structure:

```console
â”œâ”€â”€ preview/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ branchname/
â””â”€â”€ root/
```

### Edge Lambda

An edge lambda is used to route preview requests to the correct location in S3.

### CloudFront

2 CloudFront distributions are used:

1. For serving the root domain, eg example.com
2. For serving the preview domain, eg branchname.preview.example.com

2 distributions are required to ensure the fastest possible edge caching for the root domain, as an Edge Lambda is used for preview sites.
